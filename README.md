**Tired of boring folder icons when developing Minecraft addons?** Your workspace should feel as exciting as the worlds you're creating! 

Transform your development experience with pixelated icons that make navigating your addon structure feel like exploring a Minecraft world. **No more guessing which folder contains what** - every BP and RP folder now has its own distinctive, beautiful pixelated icon that instantly tells you its purpose.

## 🚀 Why Your Development Life Just Got Better

### 💡 **Stop Wasting Time Searching for Files**
Before: *"Was it in `entities` or `entity`? Let me check 5 different folders..."*  
**After: One glance and you know exactly where everything is.** Each folder type has its own unique pixelated icon that screams its purpose from across the room.

### 🎯 **Feel Like You're Building in Minecraft**
**Your code editor should match your creative energy!** Every time you open VS Code, you'll feel the same excitement as launching Minecraft. Your workspace becomes an extension of the blocky worlds you're creating.

### 🧠 **Reduce Mental Fatigue**
**Stop burning mental energy on navigation.** When every folder looks different, your brain instantly recognizes patterns. Spend less time hunting for files and more time actually creating awesome addons.

### ⚡ **Keep Everything You Love About VS Code**
**We didn't mess with perfection.** All your familiar file icons (JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, Python, etc.) stay exactly the same. You get the best of both worlds - Minecraft magic for folders, VS Code excellence for files.

## � What Changes in Your Daily Workflow

### Before Bedrock Dev Icons:
```
📁 animations          👀 "Is this BP or RP animations?"
📁 entities            🤔 "Wait, which pack am I in?"
📁 items               😵 "Are these behavior or resource items?"
📁 functions           ⏰ Time wasted navigating
```

### After Bedrock Dev Icons:
```
🎬 animations          ⚡ Instantly recognizable
🎭 entities            🎯 Purpose crystal clear  
🎒 items               😊 Navigation becomes intuitive
📜 functions           🚀 Productivity through the roof
```

### 🔥 **Real Developer Benefits You'll Notice Immediately**

**Day 1:** *"Wow, I can actually tell my folders apart!"*  
**Week 1:** *"I'm navigating my addons 3x faster than before"*  
**Month 1:** *"I can't imagine developing without these icons"*
